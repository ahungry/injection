* Injection
Dependency Injection for Common Lisp.

* Example calls
Set up a config file similar to the one found in examples/config.yml
(modeled after the PHP Symfony framework config):

#+BEGIN_SRC yml
parameters:
  foo: bar
  an_array: [1, 2, 3]

services:
  my_service:
    class: MyService
    arguments: ["first argument"]

  dependent_service:
    class: DependentService
    arguments: ["@my_service", "second argument"]
#+END_SRC

Then load up your config file with:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(injection:Container-Factory "/full/path/to/examples/config.yml" :singleton t)
#+END_SRC

And access a parameter within it by using:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(get-parameter "blub") -> "foo"
(get-parameter "an_array") -> '(1 2 3)
#+END_SRC

* TODO
Need to add service/class instancing (so when a service is specified
in the file, the #'get-service call will return an instanced version
of said service, with the arguments that are filled out in the yml file.

* Installation
Clone the repository (you do know how to git clone by now right?)

Load the system with:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ql:quickload :injection)
(use-package :injection)
#+END_SRC

* License
GPLv3 (I'll be updating to make sure to specify the Lisp library GPL -
basically, if you just use the library, your project including it is
not going to be copylefted - only if you make and distribute
modifications to this library should you make sure to make available
this library's source code).
